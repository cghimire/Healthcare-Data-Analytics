## Overview
The purpose of this data analysis is to gain a hands-on practical experience working with healthcare data. This data is public use files derived from the Vermont Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set for 2017.
Below are the questions I will try to answer using EDA.
* What is the highest and lowest cost DRG (Diagnostic Related Group)?
* What primary procedure is performed the most?
* What is the average hospital stay (in days) for inpatients?
* What is the most common primary diagnosis?
* What is the common principal payment source to pay the medical expenses?

## Data Preparation and Exploration

Metadata of the data

*The inpatient data set contain 53686 rows and 79 columns. For the simplicity, I choose only 14 columns which are more interesting for the
analysis*.

*The bar plot shows that age group of	14 (Age	of	75	or	older) has	majority in the inpatient	data:	there	are	more	older	people stay	in	the	hospital	while	under	treatment*.
