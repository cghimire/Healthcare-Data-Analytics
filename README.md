## Overview
The purpose of this data analysis is to gain a hands-on practical experience working with healthcare data. This data is public use files derived from the Vermont Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set for 2017.
Below are the questions I will try to answer using EDA.
* What is the highest and lowest cost DRG (Diagnostic Related Group)?
* What primary procedure is performed the most?
* What is the average hospital stay (in days) for inpatients?
* What is the most common primary diagnosis?
* What is the common principal payment source to pay the medical expenses?
